# Euler Spiral
 > A Euler spiral is a curve whose curvature changes linearly with its curve length (the curvature of a circular curve is equal to the reciprocal of the radius). <br>
 >
 > Check out ![MITs Euler Sprial Projection](http://andersk.mit.edu/euler-spiral-projection/) for how we would apply this mathematical equation to a projection. <br>
 > 
 > The more spirals used in a Euler spiral map projection the less distortion there is.
